Notes for city_population_impact
  *  All data is from the US Census Bureau.  Each person will need to obtain there own API key
  *  I reduced the sample size from 100 to 50 as it produces a much cleaner scatter chart and tells pretty much the same story
  *  I run regression analysis' comparing the citiy population to the following:
    -percent of population below the poverty level
    -median income
    -number of people who make over $200k per year
    -percent of median income spent on mortgages
    -percent of median spent on rent
    -median house value
    There was not data related to networh.
  *The graphs are all run using a logarithmetic adjustment.  The reason for this is that a few cities are so much bigger then the other cities (NVC, LA, Chi) that they would be considered outliers.  Given the data we are lookin at I think that it is important that those cities aree in the analysis.
